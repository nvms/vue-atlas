the input component by setting the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop to true,\r\n        <i>doing some task</i>, and finally setting the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop back to false.\r\n        It is important that events happen in that order, because the input component\r\n        is watching the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop for those changes.
