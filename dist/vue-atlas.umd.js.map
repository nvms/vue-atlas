<b>loading</b> prop.\r\n        Handle the\r\n        <b>@confirm</b> event emitted by the input component by setting the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop to true,\r\n        <i>doing some task</i>, and finally setting the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop back to false.\r\n        It is important that events happen in that order, because the input component\r\n        is watching the\r\n        <b>loading</b> prop for those changes. That's how it knows to hide\r\n        the confirm and cancel buttons.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </va-alert>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport inputMixin from '../Mixin/inputMixin'\r\nimport validate from '../validate.vue'\r\nimport events from '../utils/events'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'VaInput',\r\n  mixins: [inputMixin, events],\r\n  inheritAttrs: false,\r\n  props: {\r\n    value: {},\r\n    size: {\r\n      type: String\r\n    },\r\n    onChange: {\r\n      type: Function\r\n    },\r\n    type: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: 'text'\r\n    },\r\n    icon: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: 'undefined'\r\n    },\r\n    iconStyle: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: 'regular',\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    clearable: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: false\r\n    },\r\n    autofocus: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: false,\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    buttons: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: false,\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    loading: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: undefined\r\n    },\r\n    prefix: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: '',\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    postfix: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: '',\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    noVModel: {\r\n      type: Boolean,\r\n      default: false,\r\n      required: false\r\n    },\r\n    theme: {\r\n      type: String,\r\n      default: 'primary',\r\n      required: false,\r\n      validator (v) {\r\n        return [\r\n          'default',\r\n          'primary',\r\n          'success',\r\n          'warning',\r\n          'danger',\r\n          'purple'\r\n        ].includes(v)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  data () {\r\n    let cv = this.value\r\n    return {\r\n      focused: false,\r\n      currentValue: cv,\r\n      position: {},\r\n      showButtonsWarning: false,\r\n      autofilled: false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  created () {\r\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsCancel', val => {\r\n      this.currentValue = val\r\n    })\r\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsConfirm', () => {})\r\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsBlur', () => {\r\n      this.focused = false\r\n    })\r\n    this.$on('Va@pageScroll', () => {\r\n      this.setPosition()\r\n    })\r\n  },\r\n  mounted () {\r\n    window.addEventListener('resize', this.setPosition, false)\r\n    window.addEventListener('scroll', this.setPosition, false)\r\n\r\n    if (this.buttons && this.loading === undefined) {\r\n      this.showButtonsWarning = true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (this.autofocus) {\r\n      this.focused = true\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  beforeDestroy () {\r\n    window.removeEventListener('scroll', this.setPosition, false)\r\n    window.removeEventListener('resize', this.setPosition, false)\r\n  },\r\n  components: {\r\n    validate\r\n  },\r\n  computed: {\r\n    inputStyleObj () {\r\n      let { type } = this\r\n      let style = {}\r\n\r\n      if (type === 'file') {\r\n        style['opacity'] = '0.2'\r\n        style['z-index'] = '1'\r\n        style['position'] = 'absolute'\r\n      }\r\n      style['width'] = this.actualWidth\r\n\r\n      return style\r\n    },\r\n    classObj () {\r\n      let {\r\n        validStatus,\r\n        clearable,\r\n        size,\r\n        icon,\r\n        prefix,\r\n        postfix,\r\n        type\r\n      } = this\r\n      let classes = {}\r\n\r\n      classes['va-has-error'] = validStatus === 'error'\r\n      classes['va-has-success'] = validStatus === 'success'\r\n      classes['va-has-warn'] = validStatus === 'warn'\r\n      classes['va-input-con'] = true\r\n      classes['va-clearable'] = clearable\r\n      classes['va-show-icon'] = !!icon\r\n      size ?
