<b>loading</b> prop.\n\n        Handle the <b>@confirm</b> event emitted by the input component by setting the\n        <b>loading</b> prop to true, <i>doing some task</i>, and finally setting the\n        <b>loading</b> prop back to false.\n\n        It is important that events happen in that order, because the input component\n        is watching the <b>loading</b> prop for those changes. That's how it knows to hide\n        the confirm and cancel buttons.\n      </p>\n    </va-alert>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport inputMixin from '../Mixin/inputMixin'\nimport validate from '../validate.vue'\nimport events from '../utils/events'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'VaInput',\n  mixins: [inputMixin, events],\n  inheritAttrs: false,\n  props: {\n    value: {\n      type: [String, Number]\n    },\n    size: {\n      type: String\n    },\n    onChange: {\n      type: Function\n    },\n    type: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'text'\n    },\n    icon: {\n      type: String\n    },\n    iconStyle: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'regular',\n      required: false\n    },\n    clearable: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: false\n    },\n    autofocus: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: false,\n      required: false\n    },\n    buttons: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: false,\n      required: false\n    },\n    loading: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: undefined\n    },\n    prefix: {\n      type: String,\n      default: '',\n      required: false\n    },\n    postfix: {\n      type: String,\n      default: '',\n      required: false\n    },\n    noVModel: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      default: false,\n      required: false\n    },\n    theme: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'primary',\n      required: false,\n      validator (v) {\n        return [\n          'default',\n          'primary',\n          'success',\n          'warning',\n          'danger',\n          'purple'\n        ].includes(v)\n      }\n    },\n    classPrefix: {\n      type: String,\n      default: 'va'\n    }\n  },\n  data () {\n    let cv = this.value\n    return {\n      focused: false,\n      currentValue: cv,\n      position: {},\n      showButtonsWarning: false\n    }\n  },\n  created () {\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsCancel', (val) => { this.currentValue = val })\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsConfirm', () => { })\n    this.$on('Va@inputOpsBlur', () => { this.focused = false })\n    this.$on('Va@pageScroll', () => { this.setPosition() })\n  },\n  mounted () {\n    window.addEventListener('resize', this.setPosition, false)\n    window.addEventListener('scroll', this.setPosition, false)\n    if (this.buttons && this.loading === undefined) {\n      this.showButtonsWarning = true\n    }\n    if (this.autofocus) {\n      this.focused = true\n    }\n  },\n  beforeDestroy () {\n    window.removeEventListener('scroll', this.setPosition, false)\n  },\n  components: {\n    validate\n  },\n  computed: {\n    inputStyleObj () {\n      let {type} = this\n      let style = {}\n\n      if (type === 'file') {\n        style['opacity'] = '0.2'\n        style['z-index'] = '1'\n        style['position'] = 'absolute'\n      }\n      style['width'] = this.actualWidth\n\n      return style\n    },\n    classObj () {\n      let {classPrefix, validStatus, clearable, size, icon, prefix, postfix, type} = this\n      let classes = {}\n\n      classes[classPrefix + '-has-error'] = validStatus === 'error'\n      classes[classPrefix + '-has-success'] = validStatus === 'success'\n      classes[classPrefix + '-has-warn'] = validStatus === 'warn'\n      classes[classPrefix + '-input-con'] = true\n      classes[classPrefix + '-clearable'] = clearable\n      classes[classPrefix + '-show-icon'] = icon ?
